# API for Dialysis Patients

This project is a **Back-End API** specifically designed for managing and tracking patients undergoing dialysis treatment. It allows healthcare providers to manage patient records, treatment schedules, and other critical data related to dialysis. The API is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** for data storage, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

- **Patient Registration & Management**: Allows users to add, update, and view patient information.
- **Treatment Schedule Tracking**: Enables healthcare providers to track dialysis treatment schedules for patients.
- **Medical Data Management**: Includes storing and retrieving test results, prescriptions, and other medical data.
- **Secure Authentication**: API endpoints are protected with user authentication to ensure secure access.
- **RESTful Architecture**: Designed with a RESTful approach, making it easy to integrate with other healthcare systems.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling image uploads in Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable back-end applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store patient and treatment data.
